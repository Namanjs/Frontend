This repository is a collection of my learning, experiments, and mini-projects as I work through modern frontend development.
Most of the code here focuses on React, Next.js, and the ecosystem around them.

You’ll find practice components, small UI builds, API experiments, and notes from concepts I’m exploring along the way.
The idea is to keep everything in one place while improving my understanding of state, hooks, routing, server components, and real-world patterns.

This repo will grow as I learn — from simple setups to more structured projects.
If you’re browsing around, feel free to check out the folders and see how things evolve over time.
